# ITP Week 1 Day 2 Exercise

# Take an user's input for his age

# The user input comes in as a string so we have to cast it to a int!

# Use an if/else to determine if they are of legal drinking age.
# if the user is of age, print "Welcome!"
# else, tell them to come back in X amount of years (use math operations)

# Bonus: Add a validation by checking the type of the user input
# to ensure it can be casted as an int. Handle any other input that
# are not numbers to try again.

x = input("How old are you? ")
a=int(x)
if a >= 21:
    print("Welcome!")
elif a < 21:
    b = 21 - a
    c = str(b)
    print("come back in " + c + " amount of years")
